            <p class="p1">I'm Yasmine (I like to call myself Jasmon), I'm from Egypt, I'm (almost) 17 years old (13/08/2008)!
            I like coding, playing guitar, reading, lifting weights, travelling, discovring, and adventures!!!!!!! I am a high school student, my fav subjects are English and math...(I hate physics btw).
            My fav programming languages are (Python, JavaScript, and C++), and i really like computer science, and im planning to study it in college as my major, and also im preparing to apply for universities abroad (especially in the US!!).
            I'm passionate about a lot of fields like technology, environment and social issues. I am a bodybuilder (Yes! i really like lifting weights >~<). My fav books are "The power of discipline" by Daniel Wlater, "No Excuses" by Brian Tracy, and "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey.
            I really love gaming, buying toys and watching cartoons, that seems silly but LOL my life depends on them XD. I am a good listener, i dont judge, never did, i respect everyone's culture and opinions (open-minded person).
